  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <strong>
  <p>Brother Rafe is the chairperson of the committee.</p>
  <p></p>
   The goal of the Program Committee is to bring diverse programs to the community. These programs help us increase religious knowledge as well as include several topics which broadens our understanding of the community around us. Our Committee organizes Family nights, Fourth of July barbeque and food carnivals. Our main goal is to provide a fun and organized event for our community members.
  As a Citizen of Corona and member of ISCN, we encourage you to participate in our all ISCN programs
